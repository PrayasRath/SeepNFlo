"# SeepNFlo" 
This repository consists of the scripts,codes and data (generated) 
to (1) estimate the effect of various hydrogeologic and barrage 
parameters on the exit gradient using physics based model (MODFLOW) 
and (2) create a ML framework to perform data analysis and estimate 
the dominant factors affecting exit gradient and estimate it using 
extreme gradient boosting.
